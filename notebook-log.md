# BOT563 Project Notebook
## Data availability
I'll be using reptile UCE data from Crawford et al. 2012 (https://doi.org/10.1098/rsbl.2012.0331), which is from 10 taxa, 1145 loci, each around ~300 characters. This dataset was analyzed (along with 5 others examining the problem of turtle placement) in Brown & Thomson 2017 (https://doi.org/10.1093/sysbio/syw101). I got my nexus alignment files for each locus at the Dryad repository from the Brown & Thomson paper (https://datadryad.org/stash/dataset/doi:10.5061/dryad.8gm85).
